# EfficientNet-B0 Modifications for Semantic Segmentation on Cityscapes Dataset

This project explores several modifications to EfficientNet-B0 for semantic segmentation on the Cityscapes dataset, with the goal of improving segmentation performance through architectural enhancements.

## Project Overview

Semantic segmentation is a critical computer vision task that involves assigning a class label to each pixel in an image. This project implements and evaluates four different modifications to an EfficientNet-B0 backbone for semantic segmentation:

1. **Baseline**: Standard EfficientNet-B0 with a simple decoder for segmentation
2. **CBAM**: Adding Convolutional Block Attention Module to enhance feature representation
3. **Mish**: Replacing ReLU activations with Mish activation function
4. **DeepLabV3+**: Using the DeepLabV3+ architecture with EfficientNet-B0 as backbone
5. **Combined**: A model that integrates all three modifications (CBAM, Mish, DeepLabV3+)

## Dataset

The **Cityscapes** dataset is used for all experiments. It contains high-resolution urban street scene images with pixel-level annotations across 19 semantic classes such as road, car, pedestrian, building, etc.

- **Image Resolution**: 2048×1024 (resized to 224×224 for training)
- **Classes**: 19 semantic classes for urban scene understanding
- **Split**: Standard train/val/test splits provided by Cityscapes

## Model Architectures

### Baseline Model

The baseline architecture uses an EfficientNet-B0 pretrained on ImageNet as the encoder, with a simple decoder consisting of transposed convolutions to upsample the features back to input resolution.

### CBAM (Convolutional Block Attention Module)

CBAM enhances the model's ability to focus on relevant features through:
- **Channel Attention**: Emphasizes important feature channels
- **Spatial Attention**: Focuses on important regions in the feature maps

This modification helps the model better distinguish between similar-looking objects and improves boundary detection.

### Mish Activation

Mish is a self-regularizing non-monotonic activation function defined as:
```
f(x) = x * tanh(softplus(x))
```

Replacing ReLU with Mish provides:
- Better gradient flow during backpropagation
- Reduced likelihood of dead neurons
- Improved feature representation for subtle boundaries

### DeepLabV3+ Segmentation Head

DeepLabV3+ is a powerful segmentation architecture that combines:
- **Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP)**: Captures multi-scale context through dilated convolutions
- **Encoder-Decoder Structure**: Preserves spatial information while capturing context

This approach is especially effective for segmenting objects at different scales.

### Combined Approach

The combined model integrates all three modifications:
- EfficientNet-B0 backbone
- CBAM for attention refinement
- Mish activation for better gradient flow
- DeepLabV3+ for multi-scale feature extraction

## Experimental Results

### Performance Metrics

All models were evaluated using standard semantic segmentation metrics:
- **Pixel Accuracy**: Percentage of correctly classified pixels
- **Mean IoU**: Average Intersection over Union across all classes
- **Frequency-weighted IoU**: IoU weighted by class frequency

### Summary of Results

| Model | Pixel Accuracy | Mean IoU | FW IoU | Validation Loss | mIoU Improvement |
|-------|----------------|----------|--------|-----------------|------------------|
| Baseline | 0.7370 | 0.1698 | 0.5227	 | 0.7907 | - |
| CBAM | 0.7603 | 0.2084 | 0.5526 | 0.7294 | +3.86% |
| Mish | 0.7614	 | 0.2204 | 0.5544 | 0.7303 | +5.06% |
| DeepLabV3+ | 0.7332 | 0.1944 | 0.5207 | 0.7881 | +2.46% |
| Combined | 0.7612 | 0.2295 | 0.5542 | 0.7272 | +5.97% |

The Combined model (integrating CBAM, Mish, and DeepLabV3+) achieved the best performance across all metrics, with a 5.97% improvement in Mean IoU over the baseline. CBAM alone provided the second-best performance, highlighting the importance of attention feature extraction for semantic segmentation tasks.

### Class-specific Performance

The top 5 most improved classes with our Combined model compared to the baseline:

1. **Truck**: 0.0000 → 0.1773 (+0.1773 absolute)
2. **Bus**: 0.0000 → 0.1645 (+0.1645 absolute)
3. **Bicycle**: 0.0000 → 0.1589 (+0.1589 absolute)
4. **Wall**: 0.0002 → 0.1327 (+0.1325 absolute)
5. **Fence**: 0.0002 → 0.1120 (+0.1118 absolute)

This analysis reveals that our model improvements particularly benefit classes with complex shapes and varying scales (like people and cars) as well as classes with distinctive boundaries (buildings and vegetation).

### Model Size and Computational Requirements

| Model | Number of Parameters |
|-------|----------------------|
| Baseline | 9,945,487 parameters |
| CBAM | 10,150,385 parameters |
| Mish | 11,230,935 parameters |
| DeepLabV3+ | 15,026,575 parameters |
| Combined | 15,231,473 parameters |
 
While the Combined model offers the best performance, it also has the highest parameter count. The Mish activation model maintains the same parameter count as the baseline while delivering a 6.51% performance improvement, making it the most parameter-efficient modification.

### Key Findings

1. **CBAM Attention** improved the model's ability to focus on relevant features through channel and spatial attention mechanisms, providing a 3.86% boost in mean IoU with approximately 2% increase in parameter count (10.15M vs 9.95M baseline).

2. **Mish Activation** delivered enhanced performance on segmentation tasks with a 5.06% improvement in mean IoU, offering better gradient flow during backpropagation while adding some computational complexity.

3. **DeepLabV3+** architecture showed a 2.46% improvement in mean IoU through its effective multi-scale feature extraction, though with a substantial increase in model size (15.03M parameters).

4. The **Combined Approach** leveraged the strengths of all modifications, achieving the best overall performance with a 5.97% improvement in mean IoU, showing particular strength in previously undetected classes like truck, bus, and bicycle, which saw improvements from 0.0000 to positive IoU scores.
